# Written Report: School Spending Analysis 

Summarization of the Analysis: 
    The prupose of this code analyisis was to investigate the relationship between school spending, school size, and overall student performance, 
    using data on test scores, budgets , and passing rates for math and reading.  By creating code specifically to categorize schools based on thier 
    per- student spending and size, I identified patterns and trends in academic achievement releated to the budget of the schools.  

Conclusions & Comparisions: 
1.  Spending vs. Performance
    Schools that had the highest spending per student ($645-680) demonstrated the best performance with aveage math scors of 82.5, reading scores of 
    86.5, and overall passing rate of 82.5%.  Contrary schools with the lowest spending range (<$585) had significantly lower scores, with an average 
    math scores of 75.0, and reading scores of 80.5, and an overall passing rate of 67.5%. This shows a direct correlation between spending and performance.  

2. School Size vs. Performance:  
    Smaller chools (<1000 students) had the highest performance metrics, with overall passing rate of 91%, and the highest average math and reading scores 
    (80.0 - math, 85.0 reading).  Large schools (2000-5000 students) had the lowest performance metrics, with an overall passing rate of 75% and average 
    math and reading scores of (76.0 - math, 79.5 - reading).  This shows that smaller schools may provide an enviorment that aligns to greater academic 
    sucess, possibly due to factors like lower student to teach ratios or more personalized instruction.  

3.  Implications: 
    The findings of this code analysis shows the importance of funding and smaller school sizes in achieving higher academic performance, and administrators 
    and educators should really consider analysis like this one when it comes to resources, and classroom sizes.
